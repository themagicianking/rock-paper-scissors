# rock-paper-scissors
A rock, paper, scissors game created for The Odin Project.

<br>

In this project I will:
<ul>
<li>Use JavaScript!</li>
<li>Debug and troubleshoot a LOT.</li>
<li>I think this project may have been more debugging than actual coding...</li>
<li>In any case, I feel much more prepared for future projects.</li>
<li>I also put comments absolutely everywhere. My code feels much more readable now.</li>
<br>

User interface update:
<ul>
<li>I have switched from a prompt method of input to buttons.</li>
<li>I reworked all the logic to reflect this. Only problem is that the game will continue to keep score forever! I may change this in the future.<li>
<li>The UI is also extremely basic right now. I may come back and make it more visually pleasing.</li>
</ul>
