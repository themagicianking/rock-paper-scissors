# rock-paper-scissors
A rock, paper, scissors game created for The Odin Project.

<br>

In this project I will:
<ul>
<li>Use JavaScript!</li>
<li>Debug and troubleshoot a LOT.</li>
<li>I think this project may have been more debugging than actual coding...</li>
<li>In any case, I feel much more prepared for future projects.</li>
<li>I also put comments absolutely everywhere. My code feels much more readable now.</li>
</ul>
